I knew him from the early days of Bosch, he alwaysa had good know how and technical understanding of Automotive systems all levels. He was expreinced in co-ordination and management/orgnisation of work products including WBS, scheduling and proritization. he is smart working and result orientation, who builds good rapport with internal and external stakeholders. Always a pleasant experience to discuss and brain storm with him. additionally, he catered to programs of multiple customer projects using a single platform of ECU like EDC17C55, EDC17 C53 etc, which was added advantage to the organistation and optimized useage of resources.

I had good experience working togehter with Madhan. Our colloborations were highly productive and constructive. We both enjoyed and learned a lot working together. He has deeper understanding of the technical stuff, program & project management and ASPICE process. He is an expert for stakeholder analysis and feasibilit of the customer requirements for a given vehicle and platform. I worked togehter with his guidance as RE, when he acted as the Requirements manager. He is a good team player and motivates the team to work and move forward in a constructive manner.
